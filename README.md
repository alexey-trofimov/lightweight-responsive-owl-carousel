## Lightweight Responsive Owl Carousel

Even though jQuery Owl Carousel 2 hasn't been updated for a long time, it's still one of the best image carousel plugins out there. I really love using this carousel for my projects, and I want to share with you one of the carousel design options. It's a responsive and lightweight carousel with a minimal and clean design to showcase your work. A **demo** of this carousel is available at the following link: [Lightweight-Responsive-Carousel](https://demo.minimalweb.net/lightweight-responsive-owl-carousel/). Demonstration in **Cyrillic** (Russian language): [Cyrillic-Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.net/lightweight-responsive-owl-carousel/russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*The project uses the following colors*:

- Body bg: #ffffff
- Content 1: #333944
- Content 2: #1f2329
- Metadata: #757c89
- Hover color 1: #005dff
- Hover color 2: #000000

*Image sizes*:

- Original: 307x260px
- **Recommended size: 921x780px**

*Google fonts*: Open Sans (*400, 400 Italic, 500, 500 Italic, 700, 700 Italic*).

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to use this carousel if you want to add it to your project, since using this prefix will reduce the chance of conflicts with your project's styles.
